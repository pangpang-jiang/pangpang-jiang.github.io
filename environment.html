        <h3>Setting Up Your AI Development Environment</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome back to my first page! As I continue to share my journey learning AI with the fastai course, I believe it's important to talk about something foundational - setting up an environment for AI development. After all, before we can start building AI models, we need the right tools and settings in place.Here is a good exmaple from: <span>01-jupyter-notebook-101.ipynb</span>
        </p>
        <h5>路 Why is the Right Environment Important?</h5>
        <p>
            Setting up a proper AI development environment ensures that your tools and libraries work seamlessly together, reduces the chances of encountering frustrating software conflicts, and makes it easier to reproduce your results in the future. It also enables you to share your projects with others in a way that they can replicate.
        </p>
        <h5>路 Achieve Code Language for AI -- Python</h5>
        <p>
            Python is the preferred programming language in the field of AI. It's simple, versatile, and comes with a wide range of libraries that simplify the development of AI models. Make sure to install the latest version of Python on your machine. You can download it from the official Python website.
        </p>
        <h5>路 Coding Environment -- Jupyter Notebook</h5>
        <p>
            Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's highly recommended for AI development because it allows you to experiment with code and see the results in real-time. You can install it using pip:
            <span>pip install notebook</span>
        </p>
        
        <h5>路 Fastai: A Deep Learning Library</h5>
        <p>
            Fastai is a deep learning library which provides high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains. You can install fastai via pip:
            <span>pip install fastai</span>
        </p>
